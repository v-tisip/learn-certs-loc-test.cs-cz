  Expert-level candidates for the Word 2016 exam proficiently use the advanced features of Word 2016 for document and content management and for advanced formatting.
  
  Candidates create and manage professional documents of four pages or more for a variety of specialized purposes and situations. They customize their Word environments to meet project needs and to enhance productivity. Examples of expert-level documents include a business plan, a research paper, a book, a specialized brochure, and a mass mailing. Candidate roles may include editors, project managers, business information workers, educators, and others.
  
  Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) 2016 certification exams introduce a new performance-based format for improved testing of a candidateâ€™s knowledge, skills, and abilities using the MOS 2016 programs&#58;
  - MOS 2016 exam task instructions generally do not include the command name, as in previous versions. For example, function names are avoided and are replaced with descriptors. This means candidates must understand the purpose and common usage of the program functionality in order to successfully complete the tasks in each of the projects.
  - The MOS 2016 exam format incorporates multiple projects.
